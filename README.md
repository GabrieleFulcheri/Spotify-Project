## EDA-Linear regression - Hypothesis testing


In this project, I tried to design a linear model in order to predict popularity of Spotify's 2010-2019 most popular songs. 
The original dataset can be found in Kaggle at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paradisejoy/top-hits-spotify-from-20002019?resource=download)

The repository contains the original csv file, the R file and the R.markdown file.
